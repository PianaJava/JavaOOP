https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_j0dmvXE0xs6ra-clGz4A</br>

Here I've aquired the knowledge of:</br>

//*******Classes/Objects</br>
//*******Packages</br>
//*******Getter and Setter</br> 
//*******Constructors/methods</br>
//*******Finals/static statements</br>
//*******Inheritance, private/protected instances</br>
//*******Abstract Classes</br>
