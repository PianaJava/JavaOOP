# JavaOOP
The OOP javaOOP.zip is an archive which contains a code developed in Eclipse following this online course:</br>
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_j0dmvXE0xs6ra-clGz4A</br>
I highly recommend the course (for Italian speakers). </br>

Here I've aquired the knowledge of:</br>

//*******Classes/Objects</br>
//*******Packages</br>
//*******Getter and Setter</br> 
//*******Constructors/methods</br>
//*******Finals/static statements</br>
//*******Inheritance, private/protected instances</br>
//*******Abstract Classes</br>

<b>✓Java Basics </b></br>
Define the scope of variables // Define the structure of a Java class // Create executable Java applications with a main method; run a Java program from the command line; including console output //Import other Java packages to make them accessible in your code // Compare and contrast the features and components of Java such as platform independence, object orientation, encapsulation, etc.  </br>

<b> ✓ Working with Java Data Types  </b></br>
Declare and initialize variables (including casting or primitive types) // Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive variables // Know how to read or write to object fields // Explain an Object’s Lifecycle (creation, “dereference reassignment” and garbage collection 

<b> ✓ Using Operators and Decision Constructs </b> </br>
Use Java operators; including parentheses to override operator precedence // Create if and if/else and ternary constructs // Use a switch statement //

<b>✓ Using Loop Constructs </b></br>
Create and use while loops // Create and use for loops including the enhanced for loop // Create and use do/while loops // Compare loop constructs // Use break and continue</br>

<b>✓ Using Operators and Decision Constructs</b></br>
Test equality between Strings and other objects using == and equals() </br>

<b>✓ Creating and Using Arrays</b></br>
Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array // Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a multi-dimensional array

<b>✓ Working with Selected classes from the Java API</b></br>
// Creating and manipulating Strings // Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods // Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type // Create and manipulate calendar data using classes from java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.LocalDate, java.time.Local-Time, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period

<b>✓ Working with Java Data Types</b></br>
Develop code that uses wrapper classes such as Boolean, Double, and Integer.

<b> ✓ Working with Methods and Encapsulation</b></br>
Create methods with arguments and return values; including overloaded methods // Apply the static keyword to methods and fields // Create and overload constructors; include impact on default constructors // Apply access modifiers // Apply encapsulation principles to a class // Determine the effect upon object references and primitive
values when they are passed into methods that change the values</br>

<b> ✓ Working with Selected classes from the Java API</b></br>
Write a simple Lambda expression that consumes a Lambda Predicate expression
